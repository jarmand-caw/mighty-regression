# mighty-regression
A set of tools to facilitate creating powerful regression models, especially for small datasets (like you see all the time in real world problems!)

# TODO:
- Creating features to the power of?
- Adding TQDM to have an idea of how long something is going to take
- Making a tradeoff of performance and "randomness" of features
- Allow you to set a limit on number of features used
- Allow you to set a limit on correlation of different features to be used together
- Automate regression tests (of which I need to remind myself)
- Automatic graphing, dashboarding for EDA, etc
