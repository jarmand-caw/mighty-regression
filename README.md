# mighty-regression
A set of tools to facilitate creating powerful regression models, especially for small datasets (like you see all the time in real world problems!)

# TODO:
- Forward selection
- Backward selection
- Optimal selection (try every enumeration of features)
- Creating interaction features/features to the power of
- Making a tradeoff of performance and "randomness" of features
- Allow you to set a limit on number of features used
- Allow you to set a limit on correlation of different features to be used together
- Automate regression tests (of which I need to remind myself)
- Automatic graphing, dashboarding for EDA, etc
